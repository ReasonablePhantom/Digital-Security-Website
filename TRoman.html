	<h1>Password Encryption</h1>
		<h2>Originality and Why?</h2>
			<p><font face="calibri" size="5">  Password encryption and access codes have been used to protect computer systems for a long time now. As technology systems get more 
		<strong>complex</strong>, so do the password methods as well. Password commuting and 
		encryption is always different and no password encryption is the same. 
		Password encryption is used to <i>ensure<i> that only the user end has access to 
		whatever is being accessed.</font>

Password Encryption is the process by which a password that is saved into a databank or server is changed into a more complex. This process makes it harder to access passwords from data leaksor from someone who is attempting to attack personal information.

<h2><font size="6"><b>Plain Text "Encrypted"</b></font></h2>
<p>
<font face="Calibri" size="5"> 
<strong<Encrypted text</strong> is text that is converted from a readable text format to a scrambled one that can only be access via a certain key or login password. Encrypted text is the result from password encryption which makes it very hard to understand what is being protected and what is being hidden.  Encrypted texts are also to ensure that the sender and the receiver are the only two parties that are able to read the message. Plain Text is the information that is sent in its normal text format.

<h2><font size="6">Decryption</font></h2>
<p> 
<font face="Calibri" size="5"> 
<Strong>Decryption</strong> is the process of converting encrypted text into its original plain text. In other words, it is converted a scrambled text into normal readable text. In a way for a text receiver to understand a text message, a message is changed into regular text once it has reached the right destination, therefore decryption is used.

<h2><font size="6">Why to Consider Passwords!</font></h2>
<p>
<font face="Calibri" size="5"> 

<b>Password Encryption</b> and <b>Decryption</b> are very important in ensuring that private information is kept hidden and is only accessible by the right parties. <i>Passwords</i> are one type of protective measure to ensure that sensitive information is kept hidden only to the user. While it is normal to have one password for every account, switching up passwords is also beneficial. This makes it harder for multiple accounts to be accessed at once, hence making passwords different beneficial.
